## Features
### I used the OHLC data to make a list of important features
### full Feature list: 'open', 'High', 'Low', 'CLose', 'Invested money', 'non-invested', 'invested_amount of crypto', 'Unix Time', 'MACD', 'SMA60K', 'SMA30K', 'LastBuy', 'LastSold', 'LastBuyPrice', 'LastSoldPrice' 

### Why these features?
### https://academy.swissborg.com/en/learn/crypto-trading-indicators
### -- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
### -- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
### MACD Formula
### MACD=12-Period EMA âˆ’ 26-Period EMA
### this is implemented into the pandas dataframe 

## Researching Reward System
##
## The reward is split into 3 parts: 'Hold', 'Buy' and 'Sell'

### HOLD: 
### in the holding part, we check if the chosen action == 0 ( hold), and we always give a negative reward of 25 to reduce overfiting to action 0 ( that happened when reward was '0')

### Buy:
### First we check if the current invested money is more than 15.000, 75% of our initial investment
### Secondly we check if one of our latest actions was a buy or sell, because we want the AI to know not to sell immediatly
### If in one of the steps the action doesn't meet the requirement, we return a negative reward, otherwise we Buy and return a postive reward

### Sell:
### We first check if we have money invested if not, negative reward
### then we go on to check if we didn't buy or sell in the latest actions, otherwise negative reward
### if it meets the requirements, the invested amount of Crypto will get fictionally sold, giving a postive reward if it earns more money then invested, and a negative one if it loses money
